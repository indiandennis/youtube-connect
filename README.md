WebExtension to control Youtube remotely. Simply install the extension for your browser of choice, open a Youtube video or playlist, and then open the remote application and enter the code (or scan the qr code on your phone) to control it remotely. This is a hobby project and is not perfect, but good enough for most use. Feel free to view the source and make contributions if you wish (or just fork the project).

I built this in around a week of work, mostly because I hadn't built an extension before and had to figure out how to interact with Youtube. The API server may go down at some point, but I will try to keep it online if people are actually using it.
